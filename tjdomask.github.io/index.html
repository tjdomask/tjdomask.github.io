            <p> Hello! </p>
            <p>My name is <b>Thomas Domask</b>, and I am an aspiring software engineer (open to other positions) who wants to work towards something I care about; something I truly believe in. I have strong technical, interactive, and professional skills and an academic background in the computer sciences and engineering. </p>
            <p>My passion truly lies in working towards the goal stated above, and I hope to find that passion in the educational games/ software engineering industries. Although, I am more than open to finding it anywhere as I am aware that a B.A. in Computer Science can be useful in many industries. I am incredibly flexible for the type of position I will accept in the Computer Sciences. I simply want to put my education to good use to create something I can be proud of. </p>
            <p>In my undergraduate studies, I have taken various Computer Sciences courses working with Java, as well as online courses in SQL, JavaScript, and Postman during my internship in the summer of 2021. I am also just beginning an engineering design team project as the Head Software Engineer, where I will be leading a small team to complete our project. I am excited to share more details about that project as we progress, as well as others personal projects! I am also a member of the Software Development Club at UW-Madison.</p>
            <p>I am graduating in May 2023 and will be interested in full-time Computer Science or Software Development/Engineering roles. Please feel free to get in touch with me via email or phone. Thank you!</p>
